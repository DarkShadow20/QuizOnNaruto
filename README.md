# CLI QUIZ ON Naruto

The quiz was basically made in javascript. In this I used chalk and readlinesync package to make it more attractive and interactive.

## Installation

```sh
npm install chalk
npm i readline-sync
```

## Quiz
 
 In this app there are basic concepts like **array, objects, looping, functions, conditional statements**.
 This will take the player's name and ask certain question. For each right answer the player gets marks and for wrong answer some points are deducted.
 To make it interesting a bonus question is being made which will be available if a certain player scores more than a certain score.
 This Quiz also consists of leaderboard which help you to see how you performed relatively.
